This is just for a learning purpose, nothing else.

## Disclaimer

This project is developed for learning purposes and as an experiment to see if I can rebuild a health insurance software similar to openIMIS. Most of the ideas and concepts here are inspired by openIMIS.

**Important:** If you intend to use this project in a production environment, please ensure that you are prepared to manage updates, maintenance, and potential issues independently. This project is entirely incompatible with openIMIS and is built with a tightly module-based architecture, which means that each module operates independently and may require specific configurations to function correctly.

**Warning:** This software is not production-ready and has not been tested for real-world use cases. It is provided "as-is" without any guarantees or warranties. Use it at your own risk, and ensure thorough testing, validation, and compliance with relevant regulations before deploying it in any critical environment. The software may contain bugs, incomplete features, or other issues that could impact its functionality or reliability.

**Note:** Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome, but please keep in mind that this is a personal learning project. The primary goal is to explore and understand the complexities of health insurance software development, and as such, the project may not adhere to industry standards or best practices.
